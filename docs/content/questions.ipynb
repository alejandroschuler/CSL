We report the coefficient of gender in the regression model, which expresses the strength of the association, along with a p-value, which expresses how likely it is that we would have observed our assoication if there really were none (given some assumptions). However, we don't claim that the association is a causal effect- that is, that somehow changing a child's gender would cause a change in their math phobia. In fact, it's hard to interpret precisely what that would entail. All we're saying is that there does seem to be some relationship between gender and math phobia, and that we would be likely to find a similar result if we gathered more data. Since we have quantified our claim and shown that it is statistically robust, this is no longer an exploratory analysis, but an *inferential* analysis. We have produced rigorous evidence of some relationship."

What if the cool math classroom is in a wealthy neighborhood and the boring math classroom is in a poor neighborhood? This highlights the common problem with asessing causality: it's hard to disentangle the effects of several variables. It could be that the curriculum is decreasing math phobia, or it could be that being in a wealthy neighborhood is what descreases math phobia, and also impacts the kind of curriculum taught in schools. This kind of variable (one that affects both the outcome of interest and the independent variable of interest) is called a *confounder*. Without strong experimental design (e.g. randomization of the curriculum) or strong assumptions, it's not possible to confidently assert causality."

    "Notice that the method we used for both the inferential and causal questions was the same (regression). What's different is that in the causal setting we are intepreting our result to mean that in the future we could affect one variable by changing another. However, inferential analyses are often interpreted causally, even if they only mean to show that there exists some relationship, causal or otherwise. This is natural because ultimately the goal of science is not just to understand, but to be able to manipulate our environment to make it better. In that sense, causal analyses are almost always what we're really after. Establishing an association is only useful insofar as it can generate causal hypotheses."

They also don't guarentee that the effect will be produced in every instance, just on average. But perhaps we want to be able to exercise fine-grained control over the effect and be sure that it will work every time. To do that, we would need to understand the exact mechanism of action so that we could intervene in just the right place. Doing that is often impossible in anything but the most simple scenarios, and requires thorough and repeated experimentation. Mechanistic analyses are common in fields like physics and chemistry, but extremely rare in the social sciences, economics, or medicine. We won't discuss them further in this book."

    "Prediction is often motivated by the desire to know what cases we should intervene in. But it's important to note that just because something is likely to happen doesn't mean that we can do anything to prevent or encourage it. For instance, in the case of math phobia, it's possible that some kids are at such high risk that they would develop math phobia regardless of the curriculum they get exposed to. And, vice versa, there may be kids at very low risk of math phobia for whom switching curricula would make a huge difference. What's going on here is that the *causal effect* of curricula on math phobia in different kids does not necessarily track with their *overall risk* of developing math phobia. \n",

Be wary of proposals to use prediction models to optimize resource allocation unless you've thought through the necessary assumptions."
